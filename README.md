🎓 **Origin Story** I was raised in a family of carpenters. I got a Bachelor's in Nursing from [UConn](https://uconn.edu/) in 2013 because I hoped to make an earning helping people. After taking MOOCs and building projects for fun, I decided to pursue a Bachelor's in CS degree which I graduated from [Central Connecticut State University](https://www.ccsu.edu/cs/) in 2021 (GPA = 3.86).
