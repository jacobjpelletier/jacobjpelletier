### ü™¥ About Me   

CEO of Yankeedom.io. A health-tech company transforming how healthcare workers work. 

üìñ **Origin Story**.   

I was raised by a family of carpenters. I got a Bachelor's in Nursing from the [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/) in 2013 because I hoped to make an earning helping people. I started learning this computer science stuff for fun, and eventually decided to pursue a Bachelor's in CS degree which I graduated from in 2021 from [Central Connecticut State University](https://www.ccsu.edu/cs/). I have found this new pursuit fulfilling because I enjoy the process of honing my skills through the creative process of building a thing.  
 
Primarily I have built web apps in Django, but I am currently working more in Node/Express, Angular, and React. I enjoy building things in Javascript and **my interests are in exploring web app and REST/GRAPHQL API development through the various flavors of JS**. While University gave me a strong CS foundation, I enjoy web development because I can see the growth in my craftsmanship through the projects I build. Regardless of my current pursuits, I value humility, compassion, and curiosity.

üî≠ **These days, I like discovering new things to do with Javascript.**

### üò∏ Favorite Activities (in no particular order)

üç≥ I enjoy **cooking** and experimenting in the kitchen. Particularly I love cooking (and eating) soups from around the world. My favorite genres of food are Mexican and Japanese.   

üèõ I enjoy reading books on **philosophy**. I enjoy books on transcendentalism, stoicism, meta-modernism, and some analytical philosophy.    

üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Since being a nurse, **coding** has been a hobby, and despite the cliche, I will would probably still consider it a hobby.   

üå≥ I enjoy **nature**. This generally manifests as growing a lot of indoor plants and running outside. 

ü©∫ I enjoy doing great things with my team at our bootstrapped (socail-entrepeurship) health-tech start-up, Yankeedom.io.
