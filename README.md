### 🪴 About Me

**Origin Story**.   

I was raised by a family of carpenters. I got a Bachelor's in Nursing from [UConn](https://uconn.edu/) in 2013 because I hoped to make an earning helping people. After taking MOOCs and building projects for fun, I decided to pursue a Bachelor's in CS degree which I graduated from [Central Connecticut State University](https://www.ccsu.edu/cs/) in 2021. I have found this new pursuit fulfilling because I enjoy the process of honing my craftmanship through the creative process of building a thing.

### 😸 Hobbies (in no particular order)

🍳 I enjoy **cooking** and experimenting in the kitchen. Particularly I love cooking (and eating) soups from around the world. My favorite genre of food is Mexican and Japanese.   

🏛 I enjoy reading books on **philosophy**. I enjoy books on transcendentalism, stoicism, meta-modernism, and some anylitical philosophy most.    

🧑🏻‍💻 Since being a nurse, **coding** has been a hobby, and despite the cliche, I will would probably still consider it a hobby.   

🌳 I enjoy **nature**. This generally manifests as growing a lot of indoor plants and running outside.

### 🔭 My CS Interests
**Web is my passion.**   

Primarily I have built web apps in Flask, Django, and Node/Express. I enjoy building things in Javascript and hope to become a very strong JS web application and API developer. While University gave me a strong CS foundation, I enjoy web development because I can see the growth in my craftsmanship through the projects I build. I could (and do) spend my all my time learning new things.

**My abilities and powers**. 
I am pretty fresh from University, so my skill set is pretty general - though I am working to become more specialized. 
1. Data Structures and Algorithms
2. Basic to Intermediate Python
3. Basic to Intermediate Javascript
4. Basic Java
5. Basic C
6. Git
7. Database design and SQL
8. Django web development
9. HTML and CSS (with Sass)
