### ü™¥ About Me:
____________
> ‚ÄúI left the woods for as good a reason as I went there. Perhaps it seemed to me that I had several more lives to live, and could not spare any more time for that one.‚Äù - Henry David Thoreau, Walden. 

**Origin Story.** I was raised by a family of carpenters. I got a Bachelor's in Nursing from [UConn](https://uconn.edu/) in 2013 because I hoped to make an earning helping people. After taking MOOCs and building projects for fun, I decided to pursue a Bachelor's in CS degree which I graduated from [Central Connecticut State University](https://www.ccsu.edu/cs/) in 2021 (GPA = 3.86). I have found this pursuit fulfilling because I enjoy the process of honing my craftmanship through the creative process of building a thing.

### üî≠ My Interests"
**Web is my passion.** Primarily I have built web apps in Flask, Django, and Node/Express. I enjoy building things in Javascript and hope to become a very strong JS web application and API developer. While University gave me a strong CS foundation, I enjoy web development because I can see the growth in my craftsmanship through the projects I build. I could (and do) spend my all my time learning new things.
