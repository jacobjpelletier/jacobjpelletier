### ü™¥ About Me   

üìñ **Origin Story**.   

I was raised by a family of carpenters. I got a Bachelor's in Nursing from [UConn](https://uconn.edu/) in 2013 because I hoped to make an earning helping people. After taking MOOCs and building projects for fun, I decided to pursue a Bachelor's in CS degree which I graduated from in 2021 from [Central Connecticut State University](https://www.ccsu.edu/cs/). I have found this new pursuit fulfilling because I enjoy the process of honing my craftmanship through the creative process of building a thing.  
 
Primarily I have built web apps in Flask, Django, and Node/Express. I enjoy building things in Javascript and hope to become a very strong JS web application and API developer. While University gave me a strong CS foundation, I enjoy web development because I can see the growth in my craftsmanship through the projects I build. I like to dedicate time to learning new things. In any of my pursuits, I value humility, good humor, and curiosity.

üî≠ **These days, I like discovering new things to do with Javascript.**

### üò∏ Favorite Activities (in no particular order)

üç≥ I enjoy **cooking** and experimenting in the kitchen. Particularly I love cooking (and eating) soups from around the world. My favorite genre of food is Mexican and Japanese.   

üèõ I enjoy reading books on **philosophy**. I enjoy books on transcendentalism, stoicism, meta-modernism, and some anylitical philosophy.    

üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Since being a nurse, **coding** has been a hobby, and despite the cliche, I will would probably still consider it a hobby.   

üå≥ I enjoy **nature**. This generally manifests as growing a lot of indoor plants and running outside.
